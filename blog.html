                        <p> When I was growing up, my parents would watch CNN every morning. I would sit in front of the television and listen to political discussions even though I understood very little of it at the time. At first I would try to change the channel to something more fun than the news. But the older I got, the more politics interested me and from a young age I knew it was what I wanted to do with my life. TV helped me discover something that I’m truly passionate about and continues to inform me on the political happenings around the country. I am a Political Science major today because of the television. 
Political Science is broken up into two branches: General Studies and Pre-Law. Since I had absolutely no interest in becoming a lawyer, I chose general Political Science. General Political Science is a Social Science major that includes the study of government at all levels and how it works. It focuses on how the systems, cultures, and behavior affect how our government runs. A degree in Political Science offers an extremely wide variety of careers to choose from. You can choose to be anything from an attorney to a journalist in the Political Science field. Most politicians generally have at least a Bachelor’s degree but many have Master’s or even Doctorate degrees. I plan on getting my Master’s degree here at Michigan State University. With my degree I’m looking to become a political commentator on TV but if that doesn’t pan out I would also consider becoming a city planner, or one of the many other jobs that a Political Science degree would offer me.
	The impact television had on my career path is profound. It single-handedly introduced me to the political world. For years it was my only source of information pertaining to politics. I started watching almost every political show on TV to sate my appetite for political knowledge. Then one day I realized that I wanted to do what CNN had done for me: help inform people about the political world on TV. My determination to accomplish this goal has lead me to Michigan

State University where I hope to get my Master’s degree in five years and be on TV in six. 
	For most people, television is a break from reality or a way to pass time. Not for me. I have always used the TV as a means to educate myself on the world around me. It has always been amazing to me that just by turning on this box you could instantly see what’s happening continents away. The television serves to make us all a little less ignorant of the world and its many cultures. 
	Television itself didn’t help me realize what I should do with my future. It was the people on it that influenced my decision. Bill Maher and Rachel Maddow are my two biggest inspirations on TV. Their approaches to political journalism are what I try to emulate. They present the news in an honest, intelligent and sometimes humorous way. Neither of them are shy about giving their opinions on the controversial issues and never back down from their critics. Both are extremely well educated and always sound like the smartest people in the room. While both have a liberal bias, they never let that stop them from reporting the facts. In a time where so many news shows mislead their audience and feed them false information, Bill Maher and Rachel Maddow are a shining light. I am also a strong Democrat but like them, I refuse to blindly follow everything that my party says. I fact check information and have no problem disagreeing with the left wing when I believe them to be wrong. These two pundits have shown me that reporting the news with integrity is more important than sensationalizing it to grab ratings. Getting to watch these two giants in the media industry on TV was the deciding factor in my decision to choose Political Science as my field of study. 
	Even though I think TV is the best source of political news, it is not without its flaws. My biggest problem is with the misreporting of news to fuel a specific agenda or to achieve high ratings. The biggest culprit of which is Fox News. They claim to be an unbiased network but their track record says otherwise. They have been known to purposely mislead the public into believing things that are entirely untrue. They twist the facts to show liberals in a negative light. Their lack of journalistic integrity is repugnant and needs to stop. If a network is going to report with a bias, they should at least own up to it. That’s too honorable for the always shady Fox News however. Their reporting is a legal version of slander that

is unfortunately protected by the first amendment. Fox News brings shame upon the name of political reporting. I truly love the television and video medium but there are some things that could be changed or monitored.	
	Television’s impact on politics can be traced all the way back to 1960. At that time, a senator from Massachusetts named John F. Kennedy was running against Vice President Richard Nixon for the U. S. presidency. During the campaign, the two candidates agreed to partake in the first ever televised Presidential debate. During the debate Kennedy looked at ease in front of the camera while Nixon appeared to be sweating and uncomfortable. While not necessarily providing better answers than Nixon, Kennedy won the debate and eventually the presidency. The debate is thought by many to be the moment that won him the campaign. The debate showed how much of a factor television would be in politics for years to come.
	There is no news medium that comes close to equaling that of television. A major event could happen in the Middle East for example, and it would be on the news within a matter of minutes. This instant access to news is unparalleled by any other form of news except the internet. While matching the rapidity of TV reporting, the internet can’t compete with television in terms of the quality of the reporting. Most people would prefer to hear and see the news rather than having to read a story about it. Seeing an event with your own eyes is much more powerful than reading words describing it. It makes the event seem more “real” to the viewer. It seems that the visual medium has a lasting impact on people throughout the world.
	Television is the biggest driving factor that led me to where I am today. Without it, I would never have become interested in politics and never would be here at Michigan State pursuing a degree in Political Science. TV gravitated me towards politics and I still use it as a means to watch the news. Technology is something that greatly influences decisions people make in everyday life. Whether or not we want it to, the world is changing because of technology and technology will continue to have a big effect around the world. </p>
