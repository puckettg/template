Cultural Analysis Proposal
	There is no loss worse than losing a child. On December 14th, 2012 that’s exactly the loss the parents of the 18 children slain at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut had to endure. The shooter, Adam Lanza, also killed 9 other people that day leaving the total number of those killed at 27. This tragic event and many like it all are a byproduct of the times that we live in. Violent video games such as Call of Duty have made violence so prevalent in our society that it seems every week you’re hearing of some new mass shooting. Playing games like Call of Duty can desensitize you to the killing of others. The body count in these games is absolutely astronomical. The upward swing in violence mirrors that of the rise of these violent video games will continue to do so unless something is done. Video games such as Call of Duty need to dial back the violence or else the impact on society could be dire. 
	Call of Duty is a first-person shooter video game series that portrays realistic war sequences. The object of the game is to kill as many of your enemies as you can before the time expires.  They are extremely violent and aren’t meant to be played by anyone under the age of 17. That age restriction is more of a technicality than anything however, as parents don’t hesitate to shell out the money for their kids. These games have received high praise from players and 
Puckett 3
have won multiple awards. They are available on both PlayStation and XBOX making the series available to millions of gamers across the country. The Call of Duty franchise is one of the most successful video game series ever. Every time a new one is released people start camping out hours or sometimes even days before. While the series certainly does have a passionate fan base, the effects the game has on players is alarming. 
	The rise of Call of Duty has brought a disturbing trend along with it. Mass shootings are becoming almost a common occurrence and a good portion of blame lies with the makers of Call of Duty. These violent video games are desensitizing people to death and are making it seem like less of a real thing. Call of Duty teaches gamers to show no remorse as they gun down countless people in an effort to win.  These games portray people as a number instead of living things with hopes and dreams. To portray the taking of a human life as fun is downright appalling. In one Call of Duty scene, the player is calmly walking through an airport terminal massacring innocent people. Not only does that send a horrible message to kids, but also plants that thought firmly in their minds. It’s chilling to think about that some of these mass shooters could’ve been influenced by this seemingly harmless game. Not only are these games engraining violent thoughts into the heads of our children, but they are also extremely insensitive toward those who have lost loved ones in a war. Call of Duty glamorizes war to look like something that would be fun or entertaining. These games have no redeeming qualities and have a frighteningly large following. To think about what kind of impact these games could have on an entire generation is truly terrifying. 
	One case of a person acting on violence they learned from playing Call of Duty is that of Anders Behring Breivik. Breivik shot and killed 69 people and claimed to have used the video 
Puckett 4
game, Call of Duty, which uses a holograph aiming device to train himself on shooting. According to The Guardian, Brevik said, "It consists of many hundreds of different tasks and some of these tasks can be compared with an attack, for real. That's why it's used by many armies throughout the world. It's very good for acquiring experience related to sights systems." Brevik isn’t the only person who was inspired by the violence in first person shooters. Shootings have become so common in the media that it doesn’t seem like news anymore. Northwestern University had a campus shooting in the past two months. Even Michigan State University just experienced a campus shooting. These words and actions only strengthen the need for more regulations. While these games may be fun for some people, there is always another who will take it too far and act out on them. Gun violence and shootings have become so common in the media in recent times that regulation cannot be avoided. 
	It is clear to those who have studied the issue that changes must be made. The establishment of some sort of gaming violence commission would be a positive first step towards the rehabilitation of gaming. This organization would have the power to give a pass or fail rating to games where violence is concerned. The games would have to pass all of the standards set by the commission before moving forward with game development. There would have to be legislation passed that gave this governing body absolute control over the fate of these games. Doing so is the only surefire way to gain cooperation from the giants in the gaming community such as Treyarch and Infinity Ward, the makers of the Call of Duty games. To maintain fairness, the commission would be made up of a somewhat large group of people who hold no predetermined bias one way or the other. If for some reason a company decides not to comply with the violence guidelines, the commission would have the power to shut down all of the 
Puckett 5
company’s operations until the standards were met. While these changes might not be met with a very positive reaction from the public, it’s what needs to be done to help end this disturbing trend of violence. 
	Making video games less violent would have wide spread effects on the country. While people may at first protest these changes, they will eventually see all of the good that comes out of them. With less influence from games, the rate of shootings would show a steep decline from its current sky-high number. People would be less likely to resort to violence when not having their brains pumped full of gruesome images of murder and destruction. The commission would serve the purpose of protecting children from these unnecessarily violent images. Madmen such as Lanza and Brevik would no longer be able to get ideas of violence just by turning on their game systems. While more measures must be taken to rid the United States of the epidemic that is gun violence, the steps I’ve laid out would be a powerful first step. Reform has to start somewhere and what better place to begin than the root of it all? This problem is getting worse and will not just go away. We as a country need to step up and do what is in the best interest of the kids by enacting these reforms. 
	Our country cannot afford to sit idly by while mass shooting after mass shooting occurs within our borders. This disturbing trend of violence must be dealt with before it is too late. The desensitization of children towards violence will be an issue that defines a generation. We can choose to act now to prevent the problem from becoming even worse, or we can sit on the sidelines as we watch the streets of our country turn into a war zone. The setting up of a commission and the passing of legislation would put the United States on the fast track to resolving the issue of gun violence.

Executive Summary
One of the biggest issues facing the United States right now is that of gun control. That debate focuses on the how but not the why. Extremely graphic and violent video games play a large role in exposing children to the concept of gun violence. Call of Duty is the biggest culprit in this epidemic. The extremely popular video game puts the player in a simulated war where the goal is to kill as many of your enemies as you can.  Call of Duty makes killing seem easy and painless. Its impact on the world can be demonstrated as a body count of all the people killed in mass shootings since its initial release. This issue needs to be swiftly addressed with legislation restricting the level of violence in video games.

Lived Experiences Project
When I was growing up, my parents would watch CNN every morning. I would sit in front of the television and listen to political discussions even though I understood very little of it at the time. At first I would try to change the channel to something more fun than the news. But the older I got, the more politics interested me and from a young age I knew it was what I wanted to do with my life. TV helped me discover something that I’m truly passionate about and continues to inform me on the political happenings around the country. I am a Political Science major today because of the television. 
Political Science is broken up into two branches: General Studies and Pre-Law. Since I had absolutely no interest in becoming a lawyer, I chose general Political Science. General Political Science is a Social Science major that includes the study of government at all levels and how it works. It focuses on how the systems, cultures, and behavior affect how our government runs. A degree in Political Science offers an extremely wide variety of careers to choose from. You can choose to be anything from an attorney to a journalist in the Political Science field. Most politicians generally have at least a Bachelor’s degree but many have Master’s or even Doctorate degrees. I plan on getting my Master’s degree here at Michigan State University. With my degree I’m looking to become a political commentator on TV but if that doesn’t pan out I would also consider becoming a city planner, or one of the many other jobs that a Political Science degree would offer me.
	The impact television had on my career path is profound. It single-handedly introduced me to the political world. For years it was my only source of information pertaining to politics. I started watching almost every political show on TV to sate my appetite for political knowledge. Then one day I realized that I wanted to do what CNN had done for me: help inform people about the political world on TV. My determination to accomplish this goal has lead me to Michigan 
Puckett 2
State University where I hope to get my Master’s degree in five years and be on TV in six. 
	For most people, television is a break from reality or a way to pass time. Not for me. I have always used the TV as a means to educate myself on the world around me. It has always been amazing to me that just by turning on this box you could instantly see what’s happening continents away. The television serves to make us all a little less ignorant of the world and its many cultures. 
	Television itself didn’t help me realize what I should do with my future. It was the people on it that influenced my decision. Bill Maher and Rachel Maddow are my two biggest inspirations on TV. Their approaches to political journalism are what I try to emulate. They present the news in an honest, intelligent and sometimes humorous way. Neither of them are shy about giving their opinions on the controversial issues and never back down from their critics. Both are extremely well educated and always sound like the smartest people in the room. While both have a liberal bias, they never let that stop them from reporting the facts. In a time where so many news shows mislead their audience and feed them false information, Bill Maher and Rachel Maddow are a shining light. I am also a strong Democrat but like them, I refuse to blindly follow everything that my party says. I fact check information and have no problem disagreeing with the left wing when I believe them to be wrong. These two pundits have shown me that reporting the news with integrity is more important than sensationalizing it to grab ratings. Getting to watch these two giants in the media industry on TV was the deciding factor in my decision to choose Political Science as my field of study. 
	Even though I think TV is the best source of political news, it is not without its flaws. My biggest problem is with the misreporting of news to fuel a specific agenda or to achieve high ratings. The biggest culprit of which is Fox News. They claim to be an unbiased network but their track record says otherwise. They have been known to purposely mislead the public into believing things that are entirely untrue. They twist the facts to show liberals in a negative light. Their lack of journalistic integrity is repugnant and needs to stop. If a network is going to report with a bias, they should at least own up to it. That’s too honorable for the always shady Fox News however. Their reporting is a legal version of slander that 
Puckett 3
is unfortunately protected by the first amendment. Fox News brings shame upon the name of political reporting. I truly love the television and video medium but there are some things that could be changed or monitored.	
	Television’s impact on politics can be traced all the way back to 1960. At that time, a senator from Massachusetts named John F. Kennedy was running against Vice President Richard Nixon for the U. S. presidency. During the campaign, the two candidates agreed to partake in the first ever televised Presidential debate. During the debate Kennedy looked at ease in front of the camera while Nixon appeared to be sweating and uncomfortable. While not necessarily providing better answers than Nixon, Kennedy won the debate and eventually the presidency. The debate is thought by many to be the moment that won him the campaign. The debate showed how much of a factor television would be in politics for years to come.
	There is no news medium that comes close to equaling that of television. A major event could happen in the Middle East for example, and it would be on the news within a matter of minutes. This instant access to news is unparalleled by any other form of news except the internet. While matching the rapidity of TV reporting, the internet can’t compete with television in terms of the quality of the reporting. Most people would prefer to hear and see the news rather than having to read a story about it. Seeing an event with your own eyes is much more powerful than reading words describing it. It makes the event seem more “real” to the viewer. It seems that the visual medium has a lasting impact on people throughout the world.
	Television is the biggest driving factor that led me to where I am today. Without it, I would never have become interested in politics and never would be here at Michigan State pursuing a degree in Political Science. TV gravitated me towards politics and I still use it as a means to watch the news. Technology is something that greatly influences decisions people make in everyday life. Whether or not we want it to, the world is changing because of technology and technology will continue to have a big effect around the world.
